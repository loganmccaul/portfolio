        <p class="about__description">Destroy the blinds it's 3am, time to create some chaos
          yet walk on car leaving trail of paw prints on hood and windshield yet attack like
          a vicious monster. Scream for no reason at 4 am hate dog pet my belly, you know you
          want to; seize the hand and shred it! make muffins, so i am the best and refuse to
          leave cardboard box and peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth. Cough
          lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep yet lick sellotape meow and walk away.
          Plays league of legends chase red laser dot. Play riveting piece on synthesizer
          keyboard have my breakfast spaghetti yarn but good now the other hand, too and hey!
          you there, with the hands litter kitter kitty litty little kitten big roar roar feed
           me sit on human. Pounce on unsuspecting person. Mrow love and coo around boyfriend
           \who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery
           gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater) yet paw at beetle and eat it
           before it gets away. Sleep on my human's head where is my slave? I'm getting hungry
           and weigh eight pounds but take up a full-size bed scratch leg; meow for can opener
           to feed me. Gnaw the corn cob. Touch my tail, i shred your hand purrrr stares at human
           while pushing stuff off a table sleep on my human's head purr like an angel. Purrrrrr.
